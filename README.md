Ok So we deciding on making a TCP Server and client for both medical personel and patients. 
Involves letting a patient fillout forms that which can only be created and filled out once any edits or deletion must be done by medical personel. 
The patient can view records only.
What happens when there is an error when the patient has made an error in filling out forms??
Im thinking the Doc must be notified of the error and thus make the edit accordingly so does that mean the patient placing some sort or error notification request??
